# Project Structure

1. PRISM-extended.tar.gz <--- source code of PRISM+

2. 13_nodes.prism <--- PRISM+ specification of the Casper Hybrid protocol with 13 nodes

3. properties.prop <--- list of the properties analyzed in the paper (PRISM syntax)

4. folder Experiments <--- contains the results of some experiments not included in the article


# Instructions for the installation of PRISM+

-> Download the PRISM-extended.tar.gz file and extract it

-> To install, enter the PRISM-new directory and type ./install.sh

-> To run, execute bin/xprism or bin/prism


# Docker

-> We also provide a docker image with our implementation, available at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/meivan/bitprism


# Instructions to run an experiment

-> To run an experiment from command line, it is possible to write:
```console
prism model.prism property -const -sim -simmethod ci
```
  where <br/>
    * model.prism is the name of the file<br/>
    * property is the property to analyze (e.g. P=?[F<=T "someJustified"])<br/> 
    * after const it is supposed to define the variables not initialized in the model, in our case the only variable not initialize is epochs<br/>
  For instance, if you want to analyze the probability that someone justifies a block depending on the number of epochs you should write:
```console
prism 13_nodes.prism P=?[F<=T "someJustified"] -const epochs=0:5:20 -sim -simmethod ci
```
